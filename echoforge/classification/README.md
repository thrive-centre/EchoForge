# Classification Module

> **EchoForge Classification** provides deep learning models for echocardiographic view classification, cardiac phase detection, etc. This module serves as a central hub for all classification tasks developed by the THRIVE Research Centre.

---

## 📌 Overview

Echocardiographic classification models are essential for:
- **Standardising view identification** (e.g., A4C, A2C, PLAX)
- **Filtering poor-quality or misclassified views**
- **Detecting phases or pathology from still frames or video**

The models in this module cover tasks such as:
- **View classification**
- **Phase detection (systole/diastole)**
- **Binary/multi-label cardiac condition classification**

## 📝 Tasks Covered

| Task                         | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| View Classification          | Identify the anatomical view (e.g., A4C, PLAX) from 2D echo |
| Phase Classification         | Classify frames or sequences into systole/diastole |
| Multi-class Classification   | Predict multiple classes or labels simultaneously |

## 📊 Datasets Used

The following datasets have been used across classification models:

### 🏥 1. **T-MED**
- A curated clinical dataset featuring multi-view and phase-labelled echocardiograms
- Useful for both view classification and disease prediction tasks
- Annotated by medical experts from collaborative teaching hospitals
- Access on request

### 🏥 2. **UNITY**
- Internal dataset for multi-class pathology classification
- Manually curated and annotated by THRIVE Research Centre

> For view-specific or condition-specific filtering criteria, refer to individual model documentation.
